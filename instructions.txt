The Assignment:
 
Build an angular application that acts as a contact list manager for a fictitious club.  The attached json file has 100 fictitious members that can be used as your data.
 
The application should have the following features:
 
1. Browse the list of members in a paginated table with a user selectable 10, 20, or 50 items per page.
2. Filter the list by state
3. Search for member.  The search box should filter the members when the first name or last name contains the entered text.
4. Selecting a member will display all the user details.
 
Your application should be styled as a polished end-user application and should have a responsive UI that supports phone portrait and desktop screen widths.
 
Please use native JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.  CoffeeScript, TypeScript, SASS, LESS, etc., should not be used for this assignment.
